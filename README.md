## 💡 Overview

This project simulates a complete financial data pipeline:

1. **Financial Data Extraction** – Manual collection of key figures from 10-K filings of Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple.  
2. **Programmatic Analysis** – Calculation of growth rates, profitability, and debt ratios using Python and Pandas.  
3. **AI Chatbot Prototype** – A command-line interface (CLI) chatbot that maps predefined financial queries to analytical insights.

## ✅ Task 1: Data Extraction and Financial Trend Analysis

### Methodology
- **Data Source:** 10-K filings from SEC EDGAR  
- **Key Metrics:** Total Revenue, Net Income, Total Assets, Total Liabilities, Cash Flow from Operating Activities  
- **Calculations:**  
  - Year-over-Year (YoY) percentage changes for Revenue and Net Income  
  - Profit Margin (%) and Debt Ratio (Total Liabilities / Total Assets)

### Key Insights
- **Comparative Financial Health:** Apple and Microsoft dominate in absolute Revenue and Net Income compared to Tesla.  
- **Revenue Growth:** YoY growth highlights performance acceleration or deceleration trends.  
- **Profitability & Stability:** Apple and Microsoft show stable profitability; Tesla demonstrates higher volatility but strong growth in certain years.

## 🤖 Task 2: AI-Powered Financial Chatbot Prototype

### Implementation
- **Technology:** Python CLI script (`Financial_Chatbot.py`)  
- **Logic:** Simple dictionary mapping or if/else structure for predefined queries  
- **Focus:** Structured financial data retrieval (not NLP-based)

### Chatbot Capabilities
The prototype responds to queries such as:
- “What is the total revenue?”  
- “How has net income changed over the last year?”  
- “What are the total assets and liabilities?”  
- “What is the operating cash flow trend?”  
- “Which company is the most profitable?”
